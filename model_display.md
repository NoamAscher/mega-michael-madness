Let's sort out our opinions on good different beings' lives are, and how much we care about them.

@wealthy human well-being,1
@developing-world human well-being,0.6
@factory-farmed animal wellbeing,6
@factory-farmed animal sentience adjustment,0.3
@cage-free well-being improvement,0.3
@wild vertebrate well-being,-2
@wild vertebrate sentience adjustment,0.2
