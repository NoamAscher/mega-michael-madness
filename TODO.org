* Agenda
** TODO Change `mixture` to not use weightings
** TODO Use three-model mixture for AI safety
* Code Features
** Allow outcome distributions to be both positive and negative
It may be better to use as a two-sided log-normal distribution (i.e. a regular log-normal distribution combined with the same distribution flipped over the Y axis). Unclear about the details.
*** DONE Implement core functionality
*** DONE Rewrite front-end to allow sign changes and check them instead of hard-coding things as positive or negative
*** TODO Allow priors to be double distributions
*** TODO Make it so CI's can cross 0
** TODO Improve performance of bucket multiplication (FFT?)
** TODO Use fewer buckets and define EXP_OFFSET at runtime
Figure out a good way to determine what exp_offset should be for each dist
* Model Improvements
** TODO Improved AI safety model
** TODO Improved prior
Conceptualize estimates as being the top estimates drawn from a larger pool. That means you're more likely to get a good result by chance.

Or figure out a better way to account for the fact that estimates tend to be too high.

*** TODO Look at GiveWell's CEE's from 2007 and see why they're wrong
** More comprehensively list plausible far-future outcomes
*** TODO Competitive ems that outcompete humans
see http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html
*** TODO Somehow account for unpredictable outcomes
** TODO Answers to "X suffering prevented if we end factory farming" are correlated with inputs in Targeted Values Spreading: "P(friendly AI gets built)", etc.
** TODO For some estimates, use a distribution with the property that probability drops off faster than log-normal outside the 80% CI.
** TODO Instead of measuring wild animal utility, we want to measure the utility /improvement/. Rather than going from -X to 0 we might go from -X to +Y.
** TODO Simple frontend
Make a new frontend with just a few inputs that matter most and pass those into the backend.
* Refactor
** TODO For posterior, represent estimate as buckets instead of converting to lognormal distribution, which loses accuracy
* Bugs
** TODO When should_preserve_lognorm = false, any estimates involving the far future have mean = p_s = 0.
** TODO AI Safety model 2 should multiply by P(AI-related extinction)
* Notes
** Server is located at /root/mega-michael-madness (it's at ~/ if you log in as root).
** How to deploy
1. Run `make deploy`
2. Push to GitHub
3. SSH into root@mdickens.me, cd ~/mega-michael-madness, git pull
